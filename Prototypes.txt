objects are created by new keyword.
classes = blue prints           objects - real world instance

objects are dynamicallyy linked to their prototypes
In Java, cpp
if we create a class (blueprint) and the create an object of that class its properties are fixed they can't be changed
if we make any changes in the class then it won't be reflected in that obj we created earlier.
